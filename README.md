# Install Rails on Windows

Note: Even if you are using a 64bit version of Windows, it is advised to use the 32bit versions of the Devkit as they are more stable.

01. Go to the RailsFTW download page. [http://railsftw.bryanbibat.net/](http://railsftw.bryanbibat.net/)

  Click on the Download button, download and install the package.


03. Once RailsFTW is installed, you will have a program called "Start Command Prompt with Ruby".

  Open this and type `ruby -v` to see that your Ruby has been installed correctly.
  Also type `rails -v` to see that Rails has been installed.

04. Download the latest Node.js from the website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and install as normal.
    
Then restart your command prompt windows. You will know that it is installed if you type in `npm -v` and see a version number as the response.

05. You should now be able to create Rails apps! Congratulations!!
